    "For my final project I am hoping to do something along the lines of the Boston Housing data set where it was training a model to predict housing prices. Instead of doing it for houses, I was thinking about doing it for AirBnb and looking at which factor(s) allow for the best prediction of price. The data set I found to use is one that looks at LA Airbnb Listings (https://www.kaggle.com/oindrilasen/la-airbnb-listings). Using this data set I hope to build a model that can predict the price of the Airbnb."

    "To create this model I will use Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Keras to create a neural network. Using previous ratings, location, and other related factors, I will train this model to predict the price of Airbnb in LA. I would explore a variety of combinations of factors and look at creating synthetic features that could help increase the accuracy of the model."
