Exercise 7.1

a)
Exercise 1
    cities['Area greater than 50 sq miles and named after saint'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50)
        & cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))
    cities
Exercise 2
    cities.reindex([0, 5, 10, 3, 1])
    This is useful because it allows strings that are used as indexes in actual data. It makes it easy when reindexing
        an external list to allow for missing indices.

b) Because it allows for reindexing with missing indices which isn't uncommon in actual data.

c) It allows you to randomize the data in your DataFrame.
