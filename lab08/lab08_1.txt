Exercise 8.1

a) Pearson's correlation coefficient (also known as Pearson's r) is a measure of the linear correlation between two
variables X and Y. An example is between total_rooms and total_bedrooms which has r = .9. This makes sense because this
r value suggests a strong positive correlation between the two features. This makes sense because as the number of rooms
increases within a household, the number of bedrooms in the house is also likely to increase.

b)
Task 1:
    I tried a few different feature combinations and changing values in the training model, and ended up using
    median_income and rooms_per_person. Final RMSE value of 131.46

    minimal_features = [
        "median_income",
        "rooms_per_person",
    ]

    assert minimal_features, "You must select at least one feature!"

    minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
    minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.01,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
        training_targets=training_targets,
        validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
        validation_targets=validation_targets)

Task 2:
    def select_and_transform_features(source_df):
      LATITUDE_RANGES = zip(range(32, 46), range(33, 47))
      selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
      selected_examples["median_income"] = source_df["median_income"]
      for r in LATITUDE_RANGES:
        selected_examples["latitude_%d_to_%d" % r] = source_df["latitude"].apply(
          lambda l: 1.0 if l >= r[0] and l < r[1] else 0.0)
      return selected_examples

    selected_training_examples = select_and_transform_features(training_examples)
    selected_validation_examples = select_and_transform_features(validation_examples)
    _ = train_model(
        learning_rate=0.01,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        training_examples=selected_training_examples,
        training_targets=training_targets,
        validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
        validation_targets=validation_targets)

     Final RMSE value of 139.39
