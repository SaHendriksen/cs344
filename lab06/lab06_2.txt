Lab06 - Exercise 6.2

Remainder(Hungry?) = 7/12 * E(Hungry) + 5/12 * E(Not Hungry)
                   = 7/12 * -( 2 * (1/2) * log2( 1/2 ) ) + 5/12 * -( 2 * (1/2) * log2( 1/2 ) )
                   = 7/12 * 1 + 5/12 * 1
                   = 1
Information Gained (Hungry?) = 1 - 1 = 0

Compared to the ones we did in class, Hungry? is like Type? where it doesn't give you any new information (yes or no on
if you will eat there or not), instead it just divides them up further. Patrons? on the other hand remains the best
indicator of if you will stay and eat or not given the examples we have done so far.
