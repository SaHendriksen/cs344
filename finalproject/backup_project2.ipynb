    "The goal of this project will be to take philosophical proofs that relate to the existence of God – Anselm’s proof, argument from evil, and the free will defense – and try to achieve the best representation of them in Prolog. These Prolog programs will then be able to be queried about different facts related to the proof. For example, the existence of God, the existence of evil, and what happens when both exist."

    "I will be using Prolog to program the proofs and test them. I chose Prolog because of its ability to give facts and then query different statements and see if they are true, false, or what values can make a statement true. Prolog is a language that uses first-order logic and is intended primarily as a declarative language. This means that the logic in the program is expressed mainly in relationships which are represented through facts (i.e., evil.) or rules (i.e., evil :- not(god).). This works well for proofs about God’s existence because the situations are based on how God relates to different attributes, God relates to evil, and different attributes relate to evil."
