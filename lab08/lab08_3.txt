Exercise 8.3

a) Seaborn is complimentary to Matplotlib and specifically targets statistical data visualization. Seaborn however
extends Matplotlib and can fix two issues that can occur with Matplotlib - default Matplotlib parameters and plotting
functions not being able to operate on DataFrames and arrays that contain a whole dataset.

b) There are 397 entries in this data set with the aim of predicting fuel efficiency of cars in the late-1970s early
1980s. I think this is a big enough data set given that the years range from 1970-1982. THe other features also have a
wide range so I think that this is a large enough dataset.

c) It normalizes features that use different scales and ranges which increases the likelihood that the model will
converge. Without normalization training becomes more difficult and it makes the resulting model dependent on the
choice of units used in the input.

d) No it isn't a linear regression model because on the individual layers in the model it uses ReLu which isn't a linear
model. ReLu allows for non-linear models.

e) I would agree, because by having more hidden layers you increase the likelihood of training your model specifically
for the data set that you are training it with and testing it against. It decreases the likelihood that if you were to
run it against a validation set that you would get good results. By having less layers you reduce the chance that you
will over generalize to your training data.
