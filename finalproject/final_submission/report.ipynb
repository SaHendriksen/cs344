    "In this project, I will be using Prolog to implement and test the four above mentioned proofs. I chose Prolog because of its ability to give facts and then query different statements and see if they are true, false, or what values can make a statement true. Prolog is a language that uses first-order logic and is intended primarily as a declarative language. This means that the logic in the program is expressed mainly in relationships which are represented through facts (i.e., evil.) or rules (i.e., evil :- not(god).). This works well for proofs about God’s existence because the situations are based on how God relates to different attributes, God relates to evil, and different attributes relate to evil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first proof is Anselm's proof for the existence of God. This is probably one of the better known arguments for the existence of God. The argument originally was proposed in the *Proslogion* in the 11th century (Oppy). It was also the first, and still best-known, ontological argument.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next two proofs - the Argument from Evil and the Free Will Defense - center around the fact that evil exists in the world and what that means about the existence of God. The Argument from Evil seeks to disprove the existence of God. This argument orginated around 300 BC with Epicurus who was a Greek philosopher. In the second twentieth century the argument was updated by J. L. Mackie who calimed that the problem with evil and the existence of God was because it was logically inconsistent. That is, some of the arguments could be true on their own, but when combined they couldn't all logically exist. In 1977 however, Alvin Plantinga published in his book *God, Freedom, and Evil* a defense for why God could exist and evil still be present. It was in 1982 that Mackie conceded that the defense presented by Plantinga had successfully refuted his argument about it being logically inconsistent. However, the problem of evil still hasn't been put to rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final two proofs continue exploring how evil relates to God, but look at how they relate to God the creator. These two arguments are present in the thoughts of St. Augustine of Hippo in his book *Confessions* first published around 400 AD. The first stems from the Manichee view of evil and good as dark and light particles respectively. This view holds both good and evil as substances. The second proof is from the thoughts of Plato where evil is the privation of good.\n",

    "The different proofs above show that Prolog can be successful in implementing the logical progression from fact to fact about the existence of God and how that relates to the existence of evil. The question remains though, how accurate are these representations? While Prolog can successfully demonstrate *how* someone can logically step from one fact or definition to another, it can't tell us *why* we should believe that those statements are initially true.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major flaw in converting philosophical proofs about the existence of God into Prolog is that it loses the personal acquaintance aspect about a belief in God. There are two types of beliefs that can be used when approaching whether or not God exists - propositional belief and personal acquaintance belief. Propositional beliefs are those that are either true or false and tend to be proven using the scientific method (Clark). This approach gives a process of having doubt first, considering all the available evidence, and then believing it later. Instead, philosopher Kelly Clark argues that \"belief in God is more like belief in a person than belief in atoms\". By considering belief in God to be more like a belief in other people, the trust that is appropriate to people is also appropriate to God. That is, we don't expect that every human action or practice can be subjected to the demand for evidence we find in propositional beliefs. This presents a fairly obvious problem when implementing existence of God beliefs using a programming language who's foundation relys on propositional logic - statements that are true or false. The why for belief is found in the personal relationship we have with God and how that belief works, not through a series of true and false statements. Prolog is incapable of having belief in God as a personal acquaintance (or relational) belief, it is restricted to presenting it as a factual propositional belief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another flaw that Prolog has with this type of proof, is that I highly doubt that just running this code would provide proof. For many of these proofs, you need to know what concessions who you are trying to convince will give to you. For example, in Anselm's proof the first concession that must be given by the non-believer is the definition that God is \"that than which nothing greater can be thought\". Prolog doesn't allow for the conversation that would need to occur in order to have both sides agree on what assumptions can be made. Also it fails to offer further proof behind why different individual statements should be believed. Instead, it argues from a predefined list of facts which can prove to be weak when trying to make a convincing argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third flaw that can be found in Prolog, is that it would be impossible to implement an argument from design for the existence of God. This is the idea that when looking at creation and observing it there, we find ourselves directing our attention to a greater being that created it. Prolog is restricted to only ontological proofs which aren't able to rely on observations of the world. Instead ontological arguments can use facts developed from reason alone to make their point. As Christians, we believe in a Creator God so seeing him in creation can prove to be a convincing argument for his existence, however that can't be shown using the facts and statements allowed in Prolog.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final problem that comes with this is that in implementing proofs about the existence in this way, it borders on splitting reason and faith. This threatens the project first dubbed by Anselm as \"faith seeking understanding\" or *\"fides quaerens intellectum*. This means that we aren't using reason to put it on a firmer foundation or proving faith. We also aren't pretending that a propositional belief is a substitute to a personal relationship with God. Instead, faith and reason are intended to be mutually supportive and not antagonistic. Because of the restrictions of Prolog, it is difficult to balance the two pieces of reason and faith. Instead the focus turns solely to reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Prolog can be successful in showing how the different facts and statements that are found in philosophical proofs about the existence of God fit together. It can also show how those different statements can give way to true statments about God. However, it does have flaws and lacks the why someone should believe in God and his existence. \n"
