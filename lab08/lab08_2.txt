Exercise 8.2

a) FTRL is beneficial because the algorithm scales the learning rate differently for different coefficients. This is
useful when some features rarely take non-zero values.

b) By using bucketing or binning as a pre-processing technique on data it reduces the effects of minor observation
errors. It is a way to group a number of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of bins.

c)
Task 1:
  bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["latitude"], 10))

  bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["housing_median_age"], 10))

  bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["median_income"], 10))

  bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
    rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
      training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 10))

  Final RMSE value: 88.26

  Yes, because it reduces the discrepancies that could occur in the data which could impact the training of the model.
  By bucketing the data this is less of an issue and the model will be trained better.

Task 2:
  long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column(
  set([bucketized_longitude, bucketized_latitude]), hash_bucket_size=1000)

  RMSE Final value: 79.95

  The cross of latitude and longitude is useful because it represents a certain city block. This allows city blocks that
  are more likely to be more expensive than others and is a stronger signal for house value than each of the features
  considered separately.
