EMAIL FILTER

1) We want the ML model to predict how likely an email just received is important for the user.

2) Our ideal outcome is to separate emails that are worth the user's time and attention from those that are spam or
clutter to the inbox.

3) A success metric is the number of worthwhile emails predicted by the model (ones users have responded to). Success
means predicting 95% of the important emails that a user responds to (i.e., clicked on documents, links, responded to,
etc.) and ignoring the spam emails. Failure means the number of important emails indicated is no better than the current
heuristics.

4) We want the model to output a prediction of whether the email is worthwhile. The ideal outcome is these predictions
would indicate which emails a user should pay attention to. We can obtain examples for training data by giving the
model previous examples of emails that users have responded to and ones they have ignored (deemed not worthwhile). These
would be labeled worthwhile or spam/clutter.

5) We'll predict an email's worthwhile-ness when the email is received in real time. The outcome will help determine the
the categorization of the email.

6) Consider previous emails the user has received and responded to. Assume that emails from this sender will also be
worthwhile to the user in the future.

7) Our problem is best framed as a binary classification, which predicts whether an email will be worthwhile to a user
indicated by one of two classes - { worthwhile, spam/clutter } - when it is just received.
(This is already a binary classification)

8) Subject                          | Sender            | Documents Attached | Links | Output
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Course Registration              | Registrar         | 1                  | 2     | Worthwhile
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Free Cruise to Bahamas           | FreeCruise.net    | 0                  | 10    | Spam/Clutter

9) We applied the labels { worthwhile, spam/clutter } to each email that was received. This was determined by the
number of elements that would prompt user response - attached documents, links within the text, or if the sender has
been responded to in the past.

10) Sender, Number of attached documents
