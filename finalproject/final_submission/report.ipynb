    "The purpose of this project is to take common philosophical proofs related to the existence of God and attempt to achieve the best representation fo them in Prolog. The proofs that will be explored are Anselm's proof for the existence of God, the Argument from Evil - a counter-argument to the existence of God, and the Free Will Defense - developed as an objection to the Argument from Evil. These Prolog programs will be able to be queried about different facts related to that particular proof."
