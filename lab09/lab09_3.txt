Exercise 9.3

a)  i) It contains 25,000 images
   ii) It is similar except it does a convnet of 16, 32, and then 64. While the one we did in class did 32 twice.
  iii) At the start of the representations we have the raw pixel images but as we go further in the representations
        they become more and more abstract and compact. The representations carry less information about the original
        pixels in the image and more refined information about the class of the image.

b) i) Data augmentation is artificially boosting the diversity and number of training examples by performing random
        transformations to existing images to create a set of new variants
  ii) Epoch 30/30
        50/50 [==============================] - 5s 96ms/step - loss: 0.5098 - acc: 0.7440
         - 20s - loss: 0.5365 - acc: 0.7455 - val_loss: 0.5098 - val_acc: 0.7440

        history = model.fit_generator(
          train_generator,
          steps_per_epoch=100,
          epochs=30,
          validation_data=validation_generator,
          validation_steps=50,
          verbose=2)
