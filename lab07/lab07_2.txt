Exercise 7.2

a) Categorical means giving a label to a piece of data (normally has a set number of options). Numerical means giving
it a number. Categorical can be grouped but not ordered (unless individual categories are given values too).

b)
Task 1:
    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.00001,
        steps=1000,
        batch_size=1
    )
    Final RMSE (on training data): 167.75

Task 2:
    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.00002,
        steps=1000,
        batch_size=1,
        input_feature="population"
    )
   Final RMSE (on training data): 176.12

c) The hyperparameters are data dependent so there aren't any set rules as to how to train them. There are however a
few things to help guide: trainly should steadily decrease and plateau as training converges; run it longer if it hasn't
converged; increasing learning rate can help it decrease faster if it is going too slowly (but too high and the same
thing will happen); if errors vary wildly you need to decrease the learning rate; very small batch sizes can cause
instability so start with larger values and then decrease until you see degradation.
